# Detection Home Lab

## Objective

Design and implement a cybersecurity environment comprising four distinct Virtual Machines (VMs) using Oracle VirtualBox: Active Directory, Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team. Establish user accounts within the Active Directory VM. Integrate a NAT network configuration with static IP addressing across all VMs to enable seamless communication for event ingestion into Splunk. Utilize Atomic Red Team to simulate real-world attack scenarios aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, generating actionable telemetry data for analysis and mitigation.

### Skills Learned

Virtualization: Proficiency in setting up and configuring virtual machines using tools like Oracle VirtualBox.
Networking: Knowledge of networking concepts including NAT configuration and IP addressing for inter-VM communication.
Active Directory Management: Ability to create and manage user accounts within an Active Directory environment.
Security Tools: Familiarity with security tools such as Splunk for log management and analysis.
Penetration Testing: Experience with Kali Linux for conducting penetration tests and vulnerability assessments.
Threat Simulation: Understanding of threat emulation frameworks like Atomic Red Team for simulating real-world attack scenarios.
MITRE ATT&CK Framework: Knowledge of the MITRE ATT&CK framework for mapping and categorizing cyber threats and techniques.
